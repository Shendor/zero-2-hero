# Microservices: Zero to Hero

In this workshop, participants will build a fully functional E-Commerce application, using microservices, Weave Net and Scope, Docker Containers and a scheduler such as Kubernetes or Apache Mesos.

Building microservices is hard enough, but on top of that you have to choose a networking tool, service discovery tool, testing tool and continuous delivery engine. In this workshop, participants will build the hugely popular Sock Shop reference application (http://thenewstack.io/start-socks-towards-cloud-native-reference-application/). Participants will learn about:
