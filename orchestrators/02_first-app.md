# kubectl basics

---

* The format of a kubectl command is: 
```
$ kubectl [action] [resource]
```
* This performs the specified action  (like `create`, `describe`) on the specified resource (like `node`, `container`). 
* Use `--help` after the command to get additional info about possible parameters
```
$ kubectl get nodes --help
```

---

Check that kubectl is configured to talk to your cluster, by running the kubectl version command:
```bash
$ kubectl version
```

---

To view the nodes in the cluster, run the `kubectl get nodes` command:
```bash
NAME                                       STATUS    AGE       VERSION
gke-cluster-1-default-pool-0989cb44-3mc2   Ready     20h       v1.6.4
gke-cluster-1-default-pool-0989cb44-533n   Ready     20h       v1.6.4
gke-cluster-1-default-pool-0989cb44-mdf5   Ready     20h       v1.6.4
```

Kubernetes will choose where to deploy our application based on the available Node resources.

---

### Deploy a simple application 

Letâ€™s run our first app on Kubernetes with the kubectl run command. The `run` command creates a new deployment for the specified container. This is the simplest way of deploying a container.

```bash
$ kubectl run hello \
 --image=gcr.io/google_containers/echoserver:1.4 \
 --port=8080

deployment "hello" created
```

---

This performed a few things:
* Searched for a suitable node.
* Scheduled the application to run on that node.
* Configured the cluster to reschedule the instance on a new node when needed.

---

### List your **Deployment**s

```bash
$ kubectl get deployments
NAME             DESIRED   CURRENT   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
hello            1         1         1            1           51s
```

We see that there is 1 **Deployment** running a single instance of your app.

---

Get more info with `describe`

```
$ kubectl describe <resource> <object>
```

you can gather information about the status of your objects like pods, deployments, services, etc.

---

### Check metadata about the cluster and events

We can have a look at our Kubernetes cluster as a whole with a few commands

```
$ kubectl cluster-info
```

Will show us the addresses of our master node, as well as any running services.

```
$ kubectl get events
```

Will show cluster wide events such as images being pulled, Pods being scheduled and Volumes being mounted.

---

### Check metadata about the kubectl configuration


```
$ kubectl config view
```

Shows us the merged KubeConfig settings for the kubectl client.

---

### View our app

By default applications are only visible inside the cluster. We can create a proxy to connect to our application.  

Find out the pod name:
```
$ kubectl get pod
```
Create the proxy:
```bash
$ kubectl port-forward hello-3015430129-g95j6 8080 &
```
you can gather information about the status of your objects like **Pod**s, **Deployment**s, **Service**s, etc.

---

### Accessing the application

To see the output of our application, run a curl request: 

```bash
$ curl --data "cs rulez" http://localhost:8080
Handling connection for 8080
CLIENT VALUES:
client_address=127.0.0.1
command=POST
...
```

---

### Expose service while creating the **Deployment**

`kubectl port-forward` is meant for testing services that are not exposed. To expose the application, use a service.

Delete old **Deployment** and proxy

```
$ kubectl delete deployment hello
$ kill %1
```

---

Create a new **Deployment** and a **Service**

```
$ kubectl run hello --image=gcr.io/google_containers/echoserver:1.4 --port=8080 --expose --service-overrides='{ "spec": { "type": "LoadBalancer" } }'
service "hello" created
deployment "hello" created
```

This creates a new **Deployment** and a service of **type:LoadBalancer**. A random high port will be allocated to which we can connect.

---

View the **Service**:

```
$ kubectl get service
$ kubectl get svc
NAME          CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP    PORT(S)          AGE
hello         10.63.251.230   35.187.76.71   8080:31285/TCP   24s
kubernetes    10.0.0.1        <none>         443/TCP          28m
```
Access the external IP with curl:

```
$ curl 35.187.76.71:8080
CLIENT VALUES:
client_address=10.132.0.3
command=GET
real path=/
query=nil
request_version=1.1
request_uri=http://35.187.76.71:8080/

SERVER VALUES:
server_version=nginx: 1.10.0 - lua: 10001

HEADERS RECEIVED:
accept=*/*
host=35.187.76.71:8080
user-agent=curl/7.52.1
BODY:
-no body in request-
```


---

### Cleanup

```
$ kubectl delete deployment,service hello
deployment "hello" deleted
service "hello" deleted
```
